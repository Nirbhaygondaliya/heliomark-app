IMPORTANT: Add your Heliomark logo here!

Rename your logo file to "logo.png" and place it in this folder (public/).

The logo you shared (the "H" made of stacked blocks in blue/cream colors) 
should be saved as:
- public/logo.png

You can also add other image assets here like:
- favicon.ico
- og-image.png (for social sharing)
